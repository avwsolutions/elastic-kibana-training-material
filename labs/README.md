## Prerequisites

You may use any `Elastic Stack` environment, but as minimum we advice the following prerequisites that are part of [Lab 0](00-prereqs/README.md). For simplicity we are making use of a demo deployment using `Docker compose`. Keep in mind this is for training purposes only!!

- 2 or more (virtual) CPUs available.
- At least 16G of Memory.
- Approx 5 GB available for storage.

** This training is developed and tested using Elastic Stack 9.x release **

## Next Steps

You are ready to start with the first lab about [Elastic Stack](01-ElasticStack/README.md) setting up Elastic Stack with Podman Compose.

Enjoy the exercises!!!
