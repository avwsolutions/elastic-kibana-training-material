# Elastic Stack - Kibana Foundation training material

Elastic Stack is a data analytics solution (formerly known as the ELK Stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana). It provides a unified platform for solutions such as Search, Observability and Security at scale.

The Elastic Stack and its UI, also known as Kibana, provide a comprehensive suite of tools to help you search, interact with, explore and analyze your data effectively. All of those features empower you to gain deep insights, uncover trends, and take actionable steps based on your findings. 

In this hands-on workshop the attendee learns the fundamental skills needed to understand the concepts and start to set up Kibana, get insights with Graph and create beautiful interactive Dashboards with Visualization tools like Kibana Lens, Kibana Maps or using Vega. Main topics are mentioned in the [Labs](labs/README.md).
 
The hands-on part is fully scenario based, including helpful [lab exercises](labs/README.md).
 
Wait for the trainer when starting with lab material.

 ## Next Steps

You are ready to start with the introduction into the [Labs](labs/README.md).

Additionally I want to give credits to the ElasticSearch community and my community friends for sharing such great material (and being part).

Enjoy the training labs!!!
